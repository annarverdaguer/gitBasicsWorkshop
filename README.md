# gitBasicsWorkshop

Prework:
- Create a Github account (or use an existent one)
- Send it to me (Anna) so I can add you as a collaborator for this repo.
- Download [Github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Link Github desktop with your account. More info here: [HERE](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github-in-github-desktop)
    - *If you have any questions and doubts (more than possible, configs are always painful, you can ask either Xavi or Anna*

Exercise 1:
- Clone the project
- Take the file with your name and add a change. Any change will do.
- We will explain how to do a commit
- And a push
- And a merge :D

Exercise 2:
- We will do changes to the same file
- And discover the world of the conflicts.
- We will resolve the conflicts.
- And will push and merge, again.
